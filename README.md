# Todo App (Node.js, Express, Mongoose)

## Project Purpose

A todo list application built to experiment with Node.js, Express.js, routing, and handling HTTP requests as part of my MEARN stack training at the Information Technology Institute (ITI).

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:your-username/Todo-app-Node.js.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up a MongoDB database and add credentials to a `.env` file.

- Basic frontend interface with Bootstrap styling

## Future Improvements

- Add comprehensive documentation
- Enhance the UI with a more polished frontend
- Implement password hashing and salting
- Add encryption for user data
- Integrate JWT for authentication

## Challenges Faced

- Writing extensive code under time constraints
- Organizing code across folders (e.g., routes, controllers, models)

## Lessons Learned

- Leveraged AI to automate repetitive tasks
- Gained confidence reading and using documentation
- Improved structuring of Node.js/Express projects
